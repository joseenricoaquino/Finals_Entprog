        <h2>Muscle Relaxation</h2>
        <p align="justify" style="margin: 25px 50px;">
            Progressive relaxation yields a variety of benefits, including the development of a feeling of well-being, lowered blood pressure, decreased muscle tension, thereby reducing the body's need for oxygen and reducing fatigue and anxiety.
            Whether you're performing an athletic feat or merely doing your job, the quality of your efforts depends in part on your ability to relax. There are a variety of relaxation techniques to choose from.
            The process for muscle tension recognition begins by assuming a comfortable position of lying down, sitting, or leaning back. You should be in a quiet area, away from distractions. Check for tension in each muscle group in your body: major tension areas include the shoulders,
            jaw and forehead. Since there is tension in every muscle group, progression in a logical order is required to recognize and alleviate tension.
